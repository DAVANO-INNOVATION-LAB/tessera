// Keras and TensorFlow SavedModel inspection.
//
// These formats were reported as present by the artifact summary and examined
// by nothing, which is the worst combination available: the scan named the
// format and then said nothing about it, so a reader had every reason to
// conclude it had been checked. They matter because Red Hat OpenShift AI —
// the platform this operator targets — ships Keras and TensorFlow serving
// runtimes, so a .keras or .h5 file in a model repository is loaded by
// something a cluster already runs.
//
// Three load-time execution paths are real and documented:
//
//   - A Lambda layer serialises a Python code object into the model and
//     executes it on load. Keras 3 refuses this under the default
//     safe_mode=True; Keras 2 and tf.keras legacy HDF5 loading do not, and
//     safe_mode is a keyword argument a serving runtime is free to pass as
//     False.
//   - CVE-2025-1550 (Keras 3.0.0 to before 3.8.0): "By altering the
//     config.json file within the archive, an attacker can specify arbitrary
//     Python modules and functions, along with their arguments, to be loaded
//     and executed during model loading." It bypasses safe_mode.
//   - CVE-2026-1462 (Keras before 3.13.2, CVSS 8.8): TFSMLayer
//     unconditionally loads an external TensorFlow SavedModel during
//     deserialization, from an attacker-controlled path, "even when
//     safe_mode=True".
//
// Both CVEs are against keras-team/keras. They reach OpenShift AI because it
// ships Keras, not because the CVE records name the product — the distinction
// matters when someone checks the citation.
