// NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 mapping, for the controls Assay contributes evidence
// toward on the AI model layer.
//
// Two framings matter here and are easy to blur.
//
// First, this is a **subset**, not a baseline. It is the controls an artifact
// scanner speaks to, drawn from the priorities the DoD AI Cybersecurity Risk
// Management Tailoring Guide sets out — which maps MITRE ATLAS threat vectors
// onto CNSSI 1253 and 800-53 and separates an infrastructure layer from a
// model layer. Assay operates on the model layer. Nothing here says anything
// about the infrastructure controls a system also has to satisfy.
//
// Second, and more important for anyone putting this in front of an
// authorizing official: Assay *contributes evidence toward* these controls. It
// does not satisfy them. A control is satisfied by a system, assessed by a
// human, in a documented boundary. A scanner produces one input to that. The
// Automation value on each entry says how much of an input, and a control
// marked AutomationNone is here to record that Assay has nothing to offer it,
// not to pad the list.
//
// CNSSI 1253 is the National Security Systems categorization and overlay on
// top of 800-53; the control identifiers are the same, so a mapping to 800-53
// carries across. The overlay decides which controls apply at which
// impact level, and that is a system decision, not one a tool can make.

// NIST80053R5 is NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 5.

		Automation: AutomationFull,
		Evidence:   []EvidenceKind{EvidenceSecurityScan, EvidenceCoverageGap},
		Rationale: "This is what the scanner does. The coverage record matters as much as the findings: an " +

		Evidence:   []EvidenceKind{EvidencePolicy, EvidenceVerdict, EvidenceResidualRisk},

		Evidence:   []EvidenceKind{EvidenceSecurityScan, EvidenceScanHistory, EvidenceCoverageGap},
		Rationale: "Scans on registration, on deployment, and on a schedule, with each scan recording why it " +
			"ran. The periodic rescan is what addresses the 'when new vulnerabilities are identified' clause: " +
			"a verdict describes what was known when it ran, and CVE data moves.",

		Automation: AutomationFull,
		Evidence:   []EvidenceKind{EvidenceProvenance, EvidenceVerdict},
		Rationale: "Every verdict is bound to the digest of the bytes that were scanned, and the admission gate " +
			"refuses a workload whose artifact digest does not match the verdict being relied on. An approval " +
			"cannot be replayed onto different bytes published under the same name.",

		Automation: AutomationFull,
		Evidence:   []EvidenceKind{EvidenceResidualRisk, EvidenceVerdict},
		Rationale: "Each record carries the event, an actor, a subject bound to an artifact digest, and the " +
			"outcome. The approver on an accepted risk comes from the admission webhook rather than the " +
			"submitted object, so the identity is established rather than claimed.",

		Text:       "Protection of Audit Information: protect audit information and audit logging tools from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion.",

		Text:       "Least Privilege: employ the principle of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for users which are necessary to accomplish assigned organizational tasks.",
		Automation: AutomationPartial,
		Evidence:   []EvidenceKind{EvidencePolicy},
		Rationale: "Five roles, deny-by-default namespace scoping, and an auditor role that sees findings but " +
			"never the exploit path — enough to audit, not enough to attack. Scan pods hold no cluster " +
			"credentials at all; only the publish step gets a token.",
