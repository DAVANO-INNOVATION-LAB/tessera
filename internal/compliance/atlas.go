// MITRE ATLAS mapping.
//
// Two things shape this file.
//
// First, ATLAS renamed nearly every technique from "ML" to "AI" between the
// 2024.10 and 2025.03 releases, and retired several IDs outright in 2026.07.
// Shipping the old names would cite techniques that no longer exist. The names
// here are from ATLAS-2026.07, and the deprecated IDs are recorded below so a
// stale mapping is caught rather than silently mismatched.
//
// Second, and more important: ATLAS publishes no detection objects. There is no
// upstream statement of which techniques a scanner can observe. The Coverage
// value on each technique is Assay's own assessment, and it is deliberately
// conservative. A model backdoored in its weights produces a perfectly valid,
// signature-clean file that no static scanner can distinguish from a clean one.
// Claiming that technique would be a lie that an evaluator catches immediately,
// so it is recorded as out of scope with the reason attached.
const (
	// ATLASVersion is the release these mappings were verified against. Pinned
	// deliberately: ATLAS renames techniques between releases, and tracking
	// "latest" would let an upstream change silently alter what Assay claims.
	ATLASVersion = "2026.07"
)

// ATLASCoverage is how much of a technique Assay can observe by inspecting an
// artifact.

	CoverageDetected ATLASCoverage = "Detected"
	// CoveragePartial means Assay sees part of the technique. The bounded part

	CoveragePartial ATLASCoverage = "Partial"
	// CoverageOutOfScope means no property of a model artifact evidences this.
	// It needs training data, runtime behaviour, registry history, or an
	// organizational control.
	CoverageOutOfScope ATLASCoverage = "OutOfScope"
)
